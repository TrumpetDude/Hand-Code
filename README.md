# Hand Code

## High-Level Description of Code Function and Hardware Used

The script "processInput.py" takes input from a [MyoWare Muscle Sensor](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2699) through an [Analog to Digital Converter](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1085) (ADC) and sets [servos](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9065) or [linear actuator](https://www.actuonix.com/PQ12-Micro-Linear-Actuators-s/1825.htm) according to the input recieved. The code runs on a Raspberry Pi (we are using a [Pi 2 Model B](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-2-model-b/))

## Nitty-Gritty Code Stuff

### Overview of Program Flow

`processInput.py` runs in an infinite loop after importing the necessary libraries and initializing variables and objects for the devices. The 5 most recent imput values are stored in a list, and each time the loop iterates and a value is taken, it is added to the list and the least recent input value is removed. The list is ordered least to greatest and the median value is used to set the position of the servo or linear actuator. The value is converted to a value to that is scaled to be in the range of the hardware. The values used to scale the input are stored in a text file that is generated by `calibration.py.`

### Libraries
`from __future__ import division`
Let the interpreter know to look for more modules.

`import time`
Not currently used in the program. This is used for debugging if we want to run code with preprogrammed input.

`import Adafruit_ADS1x15`
Library for the ADC

`import Adafruit_PCA9685`
Library for Servo Hat

A list of libraries that had to be installed on the pi before use can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wVpSVv_SawRpC-WruQutOTwtWMYNuBGmzVt4C7Bn6ZA/edit?usp=sharing).

### Conversion from MyoWare input values to Servo and Linear Actuator output values

Input values from the Myoware sensor's EMG electrodes, after going through the ADC, vary from user to user. Usually, they are around 4000 relaxed and 24000 tensed. `calibration.py` detects the user's average relaxed and tensed muscle values, and through an algorithm demonstrated in [this Desmos graph](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/yhzczkmnw8), finds the values that the input must be scaled and shifted by to match the hardware's output. These values are saved to a `equationValues.txt` and they are read by `processInput.py`. `calibration.py` also sets the mode ("linear actuator" or "servo" and sets the scale/offset and the min/max values accordingly.
